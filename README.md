# 10 Git Commands for Collaborating

This is a short tutorial to learn just enough Git and GitHub to contribute to an open source project with confidence. You only need to learn a few commands and a few workflows, in order to use Git to collaborate with others.

## Set up on macOS

Clone the repository. Then run:

```
setup.sh
```

to install the required tools using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/).

## Generating a book

The files are named `part_xx-*.md`, numbered in the sequence in which they are to be compiled.

Run `./make_book.sh` to generate a [PDF](./10-Git-Commands-for-Collaborating.pdf) file.
