## Reference material {#reference-material}

* [Git Reference Manual](https://git-scm.com/docs).  
    https://git-scm.com/docs  
    Look here first when you need to learn a command. Then you can do a browser search if you need more discussion of problems that you encounter.

* Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. 2014. [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). 2nd Edition.  
    https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2  
    This published paper book is also available for free online. Useful for reference or as an extended tutorial.

* Tobias GÃ¼nther. July 2020. [17 Ways to Undo Mistakes with Git](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/surviving-with-git-videos).  
    https://www.git-tower.com/blog/surviving-with-git-videos  
    Excellent, easy to follow instructions for making things right when you mistakenly applied a command in the wrong place.

## Tutorials {#tutorials}

* The official [Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial).  
    https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial  
    A very brief introduction to common Git commands.

* [GitHub Workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47E-jcuQz5c).  
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47E-jcuQz5c  
    A very short 1 min 13 sec video from GitHub, which succinctly summarizes the `branch > commit > Pull Request > merge` workflow.

* Jenny Bryan, et al. "[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)".  
    https://happygitwithr.com/  
    Free, online R-focused gentle tutorial that starts from the very basics for using Git for your R projects. It is also useful as a reference when you get stuck in a particular situation. This tutorial provides very thorough coverage of situations that you will encounter while using Git to develop software.

* [Learn Git with Bitbucket Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud).  
    https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud  
    This tutorial is especially good if you are using BitBucket, although most of it generalizes to other hosting platforms also.

* [Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).  
    https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow  
    Excellent tutorial from Atlassian explaining how to use feature branches in your development process. The tutorial is useful whether or not you use Atlassian's [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) as your free, cloud-based repository.

* Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. 2014. [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). 2nd Edition.  
    https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2  
    This published paper book is also available for free online. Useful for reference or as an extended tutorial.

## Graphical User Interfaces {#graphical-user-interfaces}

* [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).  
    https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/  
    Highly recommended as a free, visual Git client for Mac or Windows. Sourcetree is _very_ helpful for visualizing the branch structure of your repository. I prefer to run Git commands on the command line, but I still use Sourcetree to compare commits and to visualize the relationships between branches.

* List of [GUI Clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).  
    https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis  
    A useful list if you prefer to work with a graphical user interface (GUI), rather than the command line.

## Good practices

* [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages.  
    https://www.conventionalcommits.org/  
    This specification provides a standard for your commit messages, so that release documentation can be generated automatically.

## Free cloud-based repository hosts {#free-cloud-based-repository-hosts}

* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
* [Framagit](https://framagit.org/), a deployment of GitLab, managed by [FramaSoft](https://framasoft.org/), a non-profit educational organization whose motto "[Degooglize your Internet](https://framasoft.org/en/#dio)" is backed up by many useful free, open, [cloud-based collaborative services](https://degooglisons-internet.org/en/list), offered as alternatives to Google's many applications.
* [HelixTeamHub](https://helixteamhub.cloud/)
